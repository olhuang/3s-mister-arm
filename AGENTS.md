# Agent Notes

## Safety

- Remote MiSTer filesystem mutations are high risk. Treat `rsync --delete`, `rm -rf`, broad `scp` copies, and remote config rewrites as dangerous until the destination scope is proven.
- Never target delete-capable syncs at `/media/fat`, `/media`, `/`, or another shared remote root. Limit destructive syncs to owned subtrees such as `/media/fat/games/3s-arm/`.
- For wrapper deploys, only `/media/fat/MiSTer_3S-ARM`, `/media/fat/_Other/3S-ARM.rbf`, and `/media/fat/games/3s-arm/` are owned targets. Delete scope belongs only inside `/media/fat/games/3s-arm/`.
- When the MiSTer may be shared with another agent or worktree, check `tools/mister/misterctl.sh lock-status` and `tools/mister/misterctl.sh busy-status` before deploy/probe/smoke work. Prefer local-only progress until the target is clearly idle.
- If a task truly requires a nonstandard remote root, require both a boolean unsafe override and a typed exact-path confirmation. Do not accept a bare "unsafe mode" toggle for delete-capable operations.
- When touching MiSTer deploy helpers or docs, add path validation and dry-run guidance before adding convenience shortcuts.
- Do not use `tools/mister/misterctl.sh exec` unless the task truly requires raw remote shell access; safer purpose-built subcommands are preferred.

## Source of Truth

- **Never edit files under `build/`.** The `build/` directory is gitignored and contains generated or copied artifacts. The tracked source of truth for FPGA wrapper files is `vendor/Menu_MiSTer/` (e.g. `menu.sv`, `rtl/`, `sys/`). If you see a file like `build/mister-wrapper-core/src/3S-ARM.sv`, the real source is `vendor/Menu_MiSTer/menu.sv`.

## Build

- **Always use the telemetry flavor.** The performance difference is negligible and the debug FPS overlay is worth having on every build.
- Canonical build command: `tools/mister/build-game.sh --flavor telemetry`
- Do not start with a host-local `cmake -B build/mister` flow. The build helper is the canonical path because it produces real ARM MiSTer outputs via Docker cross-compilation.
- Full build/package/deploy/probe workflow is in [docs/mister-runbook.md](docs/mister-runbook.md).
- FPGA core builds (Quartus) run in the Colima `quartus2` VM, not Docker. See [docs/agent-memory/mister-wrapper-quartus.md](docs/agent-memory/mister-wrapper-quartus.md).

## Workflow

- For implementation tasks, use the `/implement` skill (three-agent implement → review → fix loop).
- For planning tasks, use the `/plan` skill (three-agent plan → review → fix loop).
- For mature MiSTer perf queues, use [docs/agent-memory/mister-ralph-loop-v2.md](docs/agent-memory/mister-ralph-loop-v2.md) to choose the right loop type (`runtime`, `measurement`, or `workload-fidelity`) before starting another Ralph pass.

## Remote RL Agent Workflow

- For any remote RL agent, RL bridge, AI-vs-CPU, RL observation/action protocol, or remote learner work, first load [docs/agent-memory/remote-rl-agent-rules.md](docs/agent-memory/remote-rl-agent-rules.md).
- At session start, read [docs/plan-remote-rl-agent.md](docs/plan-remote-rl-agent.md) and [docs/remote-rl-agent-engineering-log.md](docs/remote-rl-agent-engineering-log.md) before choosing implementation work.
- Before code changes, state the milestone, purpose, expected effect, risk/side effect, planned files, and validation approach.
- Keep substantial RL implementation under `src/rl/*`; do not implement RL work inside `src/netplay/*` or depend on upstream/future P2P netplay session state.
- After code changes, update the plan checklist and engineering log, then commit code and related docs together unless explicitly told not to commit.

- Load [artifacts/mister-port/living-findings.md](artifacts/mister-port/living-findings.md) when you need archived Ralph loop evidence, exact rejection history, or old closeout details; do not treat it as the default working brief for new perf loops.
