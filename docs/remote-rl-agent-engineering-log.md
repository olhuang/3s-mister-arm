# Remote RL Agent Engineering Log

This log tracks implementation progress, engineering decisions, test results, and open issues for the remote RL agent work.

Primary plan:

- `docs/plan-remote-rl-agent.md`

Current branch policy:

- keep upstream baseline branches clean
- implement RL work on the local work branch only
- keep RL implementation independent from `src/netplay/*`

Project rules:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-memory/remote-rl-agent-rules.md`

## How To Use This Log

- Add one work-session entry whenever code, config, protocol, or deployment behavior changes.
- Link each entry to the relevant milestone from `docs/plan-remote-rl-agent.md`.
- Record exact commands, build artifacts, MiSTer deploy paths, and observed behavior.
- Record failed attempts too; they are useful for avoiding repeated debugging.
- Keep milestone checkboxes in the plan as the high-level tracker.
- Keep this file as the detailed implementation journal.

## Decision Log

### 2026-04-21: Keep RL Agent Independent From Netplay

Status:

- accepted

Decision:

- implement the remote RL agent as a local input provider plus observation exporter
- keep implementation under `src/rl/*`
- do not implement RL transport or scheduling inside `src/netplay/*`
- do not treat the remote PC as a Gekko or P2P netplay peer
- use `MODE_VERSUS + rl_session_active` as the v1 baseline match flow

Reason:

- upstream may later implement or rewrite P2P netplay
- isolating RL code keeps future upstream merges smaller and safer
- the RL architecture is authoritative MiSTer simulation plus remote inference, not peer-to-peer rollback

Follow-up:

- keep shared-file edits limited to small hook calls
- use neutral modules only if a helper must be shared with future upstream netplay

### 2026-04-21: Use Relative-Direction Wire Mode

Status:

- accepted

Decision:

- remote sends `action_wire` with a relative movement subfield and final attack/button bits
- MiSTer remaps relative movement into raw directional `SWKey` bits at execution time
- MiSTer does not own macro expansion or semantic policy interpretation

Reason:

- action decisions are delayed from `obs_frame` to `target_frame`
- characters may switch sides during that delay
- absolute `LEFT` / `RIGHT` actions can invert the intended forward/back meaning

Follow-up:

- Milestone 0B must verify `rl_flag`, forward/back remap, delayed side-switch behavior, and fallback remap behavior

### 2026-04-21: Round-Scoped Episodes

Status:

- accepted

Decision:

- v1 uses one round as one `episode_id`
- match progress remains observation context through `round_num`, `self_round_wins`, and `opp_round_wins`
- `frame_id` remains session-wide monotonic across episode resets

Reason:

- round boundaries reset key fighting state and simplify queue, ledger, and recurrent-state reset behavior

Follow-up:

- transition logs must preserve enough match context to analyze multi-round behavior later

## Work Sessions

### 2026-04-21: Planning And Tracking Setup

Milestones:

- Milestone 0A through Milestone 6 planning

Changes:

- created remote RL agent implementation plan
- converted milestones into a tracking checklist
- added this engineering log

Notes:

- implementation has not started yet
- first implementation step should be Milestone 0A

Commands:

```sh
# No build or test commands run for this documentation-only setup.
```

Results:

- plan exists at `docs/plan-remote-rl-agent.md`
- engineering log exists at `docs/remote-rl-agent-engineering-log.md`

### 2026-04-21: Added Remote RL Agent Project Rules

Milestones:

- Project workflow setup

Changes:

- added `docs/agent-memory/remote-rl-agent-rules.md`
- updated `AGENTS.md` to require loading the remote RL agent rules for RL-related sessions
- linked the engineering log to the project rules

Notes:

- new sessions should read the plan, checklist, engineering log, and project rules before implementation
- future code changes should state purpose, expected effect, risks, planned files, and validation before editing
- after code changes, update the plan checklist and engineering log, then commit code and related docs together unless explicitly told not to commit

Commands:

```sh
# No build or test commands run for this documentation-only workflow update.
```

Results:

- project rules exist at `docs/agent-memory/remote-rl-agent-rules.md`
- root agent instructions now point to the remote RL agent rules

### 2026-04-21: Milestone 0A Operator Setup Hook

Milestones:

- Milestone 0A: Baseline match-flow confirmation spike

Files changed:

- `src/configuration.h`
- `src/args.c`
- `src/main.c`
- `src/rl/rl_session.h`
- `src/rl/rl_session.c`
- `src/sf33rd/Source/Game/menu/menu.c`
- `src/sf33rd/Source/Game/game.c`

Purpose:

- add a default-off RL session flag for the baseline `MODE_VERSUS + rl_session_active` spike
- allow `--rl-agent --rl-player 1|2` to force one side to player-input control and the other side to CPU control

Implementation notes:

- added `RemoteRLAgentConfiguration`
- added CLI flags `--rl-agent` and `--rl-player`
- added `RLSession_ApplyVersusOperatorSetup()`
- hook is called after `Setup_VS_Mode()` sets both players to human
- hook is also called in `Game2_0()` after existing `Partner_Type` logic can set a side to CPU
- implementation stays under `src/rl/*` and does not touch `src/netplay/*`

Validation:

```sh
tools/mister/build-game.sh --flavor telemetry
```

Result:

- passed
- package created at `build/mister-telemetry-package`

Failures or surprises:

- first build failed because `rl_session.c` included `workuser.h` but not `plcnt.h`, so `plw` was undeclared
- fixed by including `sf33rd/Source/Game/engine/plcnt.h`

Follow-up:

- run the game with `--rl-agent --rl-player 1` or `--rl-agent --rl-player 2`
- verify round start behavior
- verify round end behavior
- verify winner flow behavior
- verify reset behavior
- only mark Milestone 0A checklist items complete after runtime validation
